Example:


1  + 2  = 3

1,2 needed => data => storage managment => HDFS => hadoop distributed file system
+ needed => operation => process managment => MapReduce/YARN => Yet Another Resource Negotiator

hadoop => to do big task

Hadoop1 => HDFS + MR => 2006 till now
Hadoop2 => HDFS + YARN => 2012 till now
Hadoop3 => HDFS + YARN => 2016 till now

many computers/nodes  work together => cluster
===============
HDFS => master(NameNode) + slave(DataNode)

File => tinyparts(blocks) => 64 mb or 128 mb => every block is availble in 3 copies (replication)

DataNode => home for blocks => acutal data is stored here
NameNode => metadata => SPOF ==> single point of failure

Hadoop 2 => High Availability
Active NameNode => sevices
StandBy NameNode => when active is not reachable ; they share a file "edit logs"

=================
MapReduce => master(JobTracker) + slave(TaskTracker)

Yarn => master(ResourceManager) + slave(NodeManger)
