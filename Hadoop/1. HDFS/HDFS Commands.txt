1. Create a directory in HDFS at given path(s).
		Usage:
			hadoop fs -mkdir <paths>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -mkdir /user/saurzcode/dir1 /user/saurzcode/dir2
2.  List the contents of a directory.
		Usage :
			hadoop fs -ls <args>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -ls /user/saurzcode
3. Upload and download a file in HDFS.
		Upload:

			hadoop fs -put:

			Copy single src file, or multiple src files from local file system to the Hadoop data file system

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -put <localsrc> ... <HDFS_dest_Path>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -put /home/saurzcode/Samplefile.txt  /user/saurzcode/dir3/
		Download:

			hadoop fs -get:

			Copies/Downloads files to the local file system

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -get <hdfs_src> <localdst>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -get /user/saurzcode/dir3/Samplefile.txt /home/
4. See contents of a file

=> Same as unix cat command:

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -cat <path[filename]>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -cat /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
5. Copy a file from source to destination

=> This command allows multiple sources as well in which case the destination must be a directory.

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -cp <source> <dest>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -cp /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt /user/saurzcode/dir2
6. Copy a file from/To Local file system to HDFS

=> copyFromLocal

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <localsrc> URI
			Example:
				hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/saurzcode/abc.txt  /user/saurzcode/abc.txt

=> Similar to put command, except that the source is restricted to a local file reference.

=> copyToLocal

		Usage:
			hadoop fs -copyToLocal [-ignorecrc] [-crc] URI <localdst>

=> Similar to get command, except that the destination is restricted to a local file reference.

7. Move file from source to destination.

        => Note:- Moving files across filesystem is not permitted.

		Usage :
			hadoop fs -mv <src> <dest>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -mv /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt /user/saurzcode/dir2
8. Remove a file or directory in HDFS.

=> Remove files specified as argument. Deletes directory only when it is empty

		Usage :
			hadoop fs -rm <arg>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -rm /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
=> Recursive version of delete.

		Usage :
			hadoop fs -rmr <arg>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -rmr /user/saurzcode/
9. Display last few lines of a file.

=> Similar to tail command in Unix.

		Usage :
			hadoop fs -tail <path[filename]>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -tail /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
10. Display the aggregate length of a file.
		Usage :
			hadoop fs -du <path>
			Example:
				hadoop fs -du /user/saurzcode/dir1/abc.txt
